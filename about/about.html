    		<p> I thought it would be fun to feature a lot of my friends in this "blog" because, let's be honest, there's going to be a big chance they're participating in these misadventures with me. These are all my friends from NYU who just came home to San Francisco with me for Spring Break! From the left, there's Joanna, Shehara, Me, Chandler and Yomi. We're also planning to live together next year, so I'm really excited about seeing how that goes. </p>

    		<p> This is my family! I love my family a lot. This is from the most recent time we were all in New York together, which was this past October. My brother, Nikhi is a 21 year old senior at NYU CAS, so he's about to graduate soon!. My little sister, Sonia, is a 15 year old freshman in high school and she's determined to break the NYU streak between me and Nikhi. My mom and dad are Renu and Sanj and they're about to celebrate their 25th anniversary.</p>

    		<p> My name is Maya Goyle and I'm a current IDM Freshman at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. I'm from the Bay Area in California and I've lived there my whole life. My two favorite places on earth are California and New York, so I'm pretty lucky. I'm also a bit of a clutz, so I thought it would be fun to have a little blog documenting the mishaps (small or large) that happen through my life. Believe me, there will be many of them. Enjoy!</p>
