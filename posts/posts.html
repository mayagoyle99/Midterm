    <h2> Burnt Hair and Melted Hairbrush - March 17, 2017 </h2>

        <div class="container">

    	<div class="about">
    		<p> So it was a regular day in the Goyle household and I had just gotten out of the shower. Everything is going as planned, and I decide to blow-dry my hair. This is absolutely nothing new, as I blow-dry my hair almost every time I was my hair, so you could say I’m very experienced in this field. I was home for spring break, which means I was using all of my sister’s products, i.e. her hairbrush and her blowdryer. After a couple minutes of drying my hair I noticed a disgusting smell, almost like brunt rubber, but I continued on. Then I started seeing little black flakes all over the counter and the floor. It was a mixture of burnt pieces of hair and shreds of the melted hairbrush because I had held the blowdryer in the same place for too long. (I’d like to stress again that I blow-dry my hair at least 3 times a week regularly) The brush ended up with a giant melted spot in the middle of the bristles and my hair had a big patch with semi-burnt pieces. The moral of this story is, pay attention while you’re blowdrying your hair kids.

    <h2> Gum in Hair - March 14, 2017</h2>

    <div class="container">

    	<div class="about">
    		<p>My friends and I were at the movies watching The Post with Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks (great movie, by the way) and I was chewing gum. Halfway through the movie I got sick of chewing it, but obviously I knew I couldn’t just spit it out so I left it in my mouth. Then somehow, suddenly my mouth just opened and the gum rolled out. I honestly don’t know how it happened. I tried to get it quickly but it was too late, the damage was already done, the gum was in my hair. I leaned to the right and whispered to Joann, “I dropped my gum in my hair” and she proceeded to silently laugh to herself. The worst part was that I had to sit there for the next hour forcing myself to not think about the gum in my hair. The second the movie ended I sprinted past Chandler and Yomi and ran to the bathroom. I think Shehara told them it was “girl troubles” so I can’t imagine what they thought was going on. After tugging at it for a while, we made the trek to CVS and Joann bought the dreaded pair of scissors. She literally had to Cut. My. Hair… Disgusting… That’ll go down as one of my more embarrassing moments, but definitely not the most embarrassing.
